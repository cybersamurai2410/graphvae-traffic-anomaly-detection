# Anomaly Detection in Urban Traffic using Graph Variational Autoencoders 
Implemented GraphVAE trained on the METR-LA traffic speed time-series dataset with graph convolutional network with encoder-decoder architecture for modeling spatiotemporal sensor patterns and detecting anomalies in traffic through reconstruction error.
