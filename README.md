# graphvae-traffic-anomaly-detection
Unsupervised anomaly detection in real-world road traffic using Graph Variational Autoencoders (GraphVAE) trained on the METR-LA dataset. Implements a GCN-based encoder-decoder architecture for modeling spatiotemporal sensor patterns and detecting anomalies through reconstruction error.
